## About Me

I am a data scientist with a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics, specializing in survival analysis, medical AI, and uncertainty quantification for large language models.  
My work focuses on extracting reliable insights from complex data and building models with clear, quantitative justification. I enjoy understanding unfamiliar domains quickly and applying statistical and machine learning methods to real problems in healthcare and beyond.

I have research and project experience across survival modeling, medical LLM evaluation, wearable time-series analysis, Bayesian statistics, and spatio-temporal modeling.
